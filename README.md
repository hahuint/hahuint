Hahuint: Open Source AI for All

About Us
Hahuint, an initiative under Hahuprime, is dedicated to developing an open-source AI framework, hahuAI, aimed at making artificial intelligence accessible to everyone. Our mission is to break down geographic, cultural, and linguistic barriers to ensure that AI technologies are available for all, with a special emphasis on low-resource languages.

Our Vision
We believe that AI should empower individuals and communities worldwide. By focusing on languages such as Amharic and Tigrinya, we strive to create inclusive solutions that cater to the needs of diverse populations. Our goal is to foster innovation and collaboration in the AI space, enabling users to harness the power of technology regardless of their background.
